# treef-cli

Terminal client for [Tree](https://tree.tabors.site) — a context management system for organizing AI, data, and ideas into living structure. Navigate your trees like a filesystem.

## Install

```bash
npm install -g treef-cli
```

## Quick Start

```bash
treef login --key YOUR_API_KEY    # get your key from tree.tabors.site
treef start                       # launch the interactive shell
```

```
roots                        # list your trees
root Life Plan               # enter a tree
ls                           # list children
mkdir Health, Work, Projects # create nodes
cd Health                    # navigate deeper

chat make me a weekly workout plan
tree                         # see the structure it built
cd Workouts                  # go into a node it created
place did 20 pushups today   # AI logs it in the right spot
note stretch before next session

root work /                         # back to tree root
cd Q2 Goals -r               # find it anywhere in the tree
values --global              # see values across the whole tree

idea i should track my sleep # AI places it in the right tree
home                         # back to user home

## Name Matching

All commands accept names or IDs. No quotes needed for multi-word names. Matching order:

1. Exact ID or ID prefix
2. Exact name (case-insensitive)
3. Name starts with query
4. Name contains query

Multiple matches prompt you to disambiguate by ID.

## Examples

### Let AI build your structure

```
root Startup
chat I need to plan a product launch for March —
     landing page, email sequence, social, and a demo video

tree                             # see what it built
cd Launch/Landing Page
note hero section should lead with the compression angle
```

Don't pre-build the tree. Describe what you need and let AI create the hierarchy, then navigate into it and start adding detail.

### Fire off ideas throughout the day

```
idea we should batch API calls to reduce token waste
idea the onboarding flow feels too long
idea what if nodes could have expiration dates
ideas                            # see what's pending
ideas -d                         # check what landed
```

Ideas don't need a tree selected. AI matches each one to the right tree and places it. Check back later to see where things ended up.

### Track values across a whole tree

```
root Fitness
cd Workouts/Pushups
value reps 20
cd /Workouts/Running
value miles 3.1
cd /
values -g                        # totals across every branch
values -t                        # per-node breakdown
goal miles 100
```

Values roll up. Set them deep in the tree, read them from anywhere.

### Compress a branch before a decision

```
root Product
cd Roadmap
understand what are the open questions and blockers
```

An understanding run reads every node and note under the branch and returns a compressed encoding. Useful before planning sessions or when a branch gets deep.

### Collaborate on a shared tree

```
root Team Wiki
invite alex
team                             # see contributors
notes -q "auth"                  # find what others added
tags                             # see where you've been @mentioned
```

### Morning routine from the terminal

```
treef start
root Life
calendar                         # what's scheduled today
cd -r Workouts                   # jump straight there
place ran 5k, felt good
cd /
dream-time 9:30pm               # AI cleans up tonight
```

Set a dream time and the AI will reorganize, compress, and maintain your tree overnight.

### Share your work

```
cd Projects/Blog Post
book                             # preview the full book of notes
share book                       # get a public link
link gateway                     # open the gateway view
```
